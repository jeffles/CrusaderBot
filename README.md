"# CrusaderBot" 
In order to get this program working you are going to need to install python, and the pyautogui package:

It is currently designed to run against the Kongregate client in full screen. If you are having problems getting this
to run on another platform, or client... let me know. Steam centers it differently on the screen for instance and 
many locations will need to be tweaked. I could do this, but first I want someone to confirm they actually have it running
and would use it. 


So to run the bot... put it in full screen mode, and close out any ads. Then run the program. 

I have simplified it to the following orders
Continuously
- Gather resources
Every minute 
- level Hermit and Werewolf as much as possible. 
Every 16 minutes
- Activate all your powers

I removed the code which buys skills, levels all, resets, restarts, sends tweets etc...
If you actually get this up and running and want to add more, then let's talk.
